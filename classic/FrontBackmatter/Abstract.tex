% The boom in usage of ML applications goes hand in hand with a boom in its energy costs. This necessitates a better understanding of present and future ML performance characteristics. No previous work has profiled both time and energy for inference and training while providing predictions for unknown operations. We therefore contribute a pipeline to profile all four cases and a model to predict all of them. Lastly we contribute detailed results and validations, along with obervations on general trends for optimally efficient execution. We provide a tool enabling the correct choice of target GPU and clock speed for existing and future models.



The fast broader adoption of ML applications has caused a surge in energy costs, necessitating a better understanding of tradeoffs between time and energy for ML performance. Previous work was limited to time-only or to inference-only studies. We contribute: (1) time and energy profiling across inference and training, (2) performance prediction trained on our profiling results and (3) graphical evalutation and validation of profiling and predictor results. Profiling results of A30 performance across several core clocks reveal an energy optimum of 900 MHz, aligning with the manufacturer base clock of 930 MHz. This work provides the tools, which enable the correct choice of target GPU and clock speed for existing and future models.
