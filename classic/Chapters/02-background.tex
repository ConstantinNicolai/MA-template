Sponner \\
metrics: power consumption, latency, memory foorprint \\
prediction method: ERT extremely randomized trees, with XGBoost \\
framework: TVM, which I think allows the largest heterogenity of targets \\
Only inference, since we cannot match this work in any other measure, we at least need to beat it here by also including training\\


Ying Li: Path Beyond Simulators \\
metrics: latency\\
prediction method: Linear regression\\
framework: Pytorch\\
