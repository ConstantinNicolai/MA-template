\section{State of the Art}
The challenge of predicting neural network performance has invited a multitude of approaches.
Apart from the methodological approaches they also differ in a number of other aspects.
While execution time is commonly the metric of choice, only few go further and also study metrics
like power consumption and memory footprint. Another important distinction is the workload studied
in the work, more specifically, whether both training and inference are studied.
For practical reasons it is also relevant which machine learning framework is used and what hardware
targets are required and can be predicted for. These many dimensions of possibility result in no work
covering all possibilities, but allows for many different approaches which have use cases in a given
situation.

\section{Related Work}
Kaufmann et al. take an approach of performance modeling by means of the computation graph. They are
however limited to the Google Tensor Processing Unit in this work \cite{kaufman_learned_2021}. \\
Justus et al. take an approach exploiting the modular and repetitive nature of DNNs. Given the same operations
are repeated over and over in training, often only varying in a few key parameters, the execution time for
these base building blocks is measured. This is then done for one batch in the training process and
generalized to the whole training process from there. There is however no presentation of the 
methodology for the execution time measurements \cite{justus_predicting_2018}. \\
Qi et al. present PALEO which employs an analytical approach towards predicting the execution for both
training and inference of deep neural networks. The analytical approach brings both advantages and disadvantages
with it. It does not require a dataset of measured execution times as a training set in the same way many 
other works do, but on the other hand it also is based on more fixed assumptions about the DNN execution 
than a more data driven approach \cite{qi_paleo_2017}. \\
Wang et al. approach with a multi-layer regression model to predict execution time for training and inference.
Their work is however rather limited in terms of hardware targets and different DNNs studied \cite{wang_perfnet_2020}. \\
Cai et al. focus their work, NeuralPower, on CNNs running on GPUs. For each target GPU, they collect
a dataset and fit a sparse polynomial regression model to predict power, runtime, and energy consumption.
While NeuralPower achieves good results, its usefulness has become limited due to its exclusive focus on 
CNNs, as other DNN architectures have grown in popularity \cite{cai_neuralpower_nodate}. \\
Gianitti et al. also exploit the modular nature of DNNs in their approach. They define a complexity
metric for each layer type, optionally including back propagation terms, allowing them to predict
execution times for both training and inference. However, their method faces significant limitations,
as the complexity metric is only defined for a specific set of operations, making it incompatible with
networks that include layers not covered in the original work. As a result, their approach is essentially
limited to classic CNN architectures \cite{gianniti_performance_nodate}. \\
Velasco-Montero et el. also take the familiar per-layer approach. Their predictions are based on linear
regression models per type of layer, but again for a specific set of predefined operations. Given their 
focus on low-cost vision devices these restrictions are reasonable, but limit generalizability \cite{velasco-montero_previous_2020}. \\
Sponner et al. take a broad approach in their work. It works in the TVM framework giving it high flexibility
in target hardware and studied metrics. It is in fact the only work to include execution time, power
consumption and memory allocation. Given the automated data collection used to create the dataset basis
for the predictions, there are also few limitations to the networks that can be studied with this. 
The predictions are based on an extremely randomized tree (ERT) approach with XGBoosting applied. The 
only major drawback for this work is its limitation to only study inference, due to TVMs limitation to inference \cite{sponner_ai-driven_2022}. \\



\section{Research Gap}
% Despite a considerable amount of works on this topic, no single one was able to cover all possible angles to interest,
% even though Sponner et al. managed to cover a considerable number.
Despite a considerable amount of work on this topic, no single study has covered all possible angles of interest, even though Sponner et al. managed to address a considerable number. But given the current landscape of available publications
our work will focus on finding the best GPU for a PyTorch job. In order to achieve that, we will cover
execution time, power and energy consumption and will provide inference and training predictions for these
metrics. Our approach also employs a different method of automatic dataset collection, which allows
for a broad field of study. Power readings are collected directly through nvidia-smi.
While this limits our work to Nvidia GPUs, this methodology could just as well be applied to any other hardware target which supports reporting power readings.
