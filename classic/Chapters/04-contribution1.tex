\chapter{Dataset Collection}\label{chap:contrib1}

This contribution serves to introduce the method used
to collect a profiling dataset spanning a number of
parameters which serves as the training set for the
prediction model. The dataset spans operations from
Torchvision models and input sizes, execution time 
and power, inference and training case as well as
different GPUs and various GPU clocks.
