\section{Discussion}

The approach we took in this work was of an exploratory nature. Rather than diving deep into one specific configuration, we chose to go wide and look at multiple hardware and many, many neural network scenarios. That approach turned out to be both blessing and curse. A blessing, because bare any limitations, the results would be applicable in a very wide field of applications and our findings are understandable at a more abstract level, which does not require a detailed understanding of subject matter. A curse, because we have to hamper our scientific curiosity not to follow every rabbit hole we encounter on our journey. Given the wide approach, we also encounter a wide range is troubleshooting issues, of various importance to the study itself. This balancing act of weighing the cost and benefit of following up interesting trends and deciding whether to invest the time to overcome obstacles was the most difficult part of this work. In the same way in which there is no end in going deep, no state of completeness, there is also no completeness to be achieved in going wide. And while, from an approriate distance, this is obvious, it is also fundamentally frustrating to deal with.\\
In order to go wide, one would like to include a large number of hardware scenarios and study all of them with the same set of accurate tools. In an ideal setting, we would include GPUs from Nvidia, AMD, Intel and further FPGAs and other ML accelerating coprocessors such as IPUs. But the platforms and tools are to varied, that even if we found a tool which was able to measure power for many of them, we would likely give up both time and power resolution in exchange for the improved compatibility. Another simple but very important limitation is the question of the hardware available to us. Because of these considerations as well as in order to keep the scope of this thesis in check, we decided to limit ourselves to Nvidia GPUs.
